### Hi there 👋

<!--
**jnfran92/jnfran92** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am from Quito-Ecuador 🇪🇨, but now I am living in Santiago-Chile 🇨🇱. Recently, I finished my master degree in Computer Science at UACh (trying to get my thesis published, coming soon..).

Currently, I am working at everis💚 as Software Developer. I am looking for new research projects or something fun in Android or Python (If you too, feel free to contact me ).
